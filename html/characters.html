          Mario Party DS is a 2007 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and
          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is the second handheld
          game in the Mario Party series, as well as the last game in the series
          to be developed by Hudson Soft, as all subsequent games have been
          developed by NDcube. Like most installments in the Mario Party series,
          Mario Party DS features characters of the Mario franchise competing in
          a board game with a variety of minigames, many of which utilize the
          console's unique features, including its built-in microphone, dual
          screen and touch screen mechanics, and motion sensitivity. Up to four
          human players can compete at a time, though characters can also be
          computer-controlled. Although Mario Party DS received mixed reviews,
          with general praise for its minigame variety and criticism for its
          absence of an online multiplayer mode, the game has sold more than
          nine million units worldwide, making it the 11th-best-selling game for
          the Nintendo DS.
