          Jon Snow, one of the most iconic characters in Game of Thrones, is
          portrayed by Kit Harington. Raised as the illegitimate son of Eddard
          Stark at Winterfell, Jon grew up facing stigma and isolation. He
          joined the Night's Watch, where he proved himself to be a natural
          leader and formidable fighter. Secretly, Jon is the son of Lyanna
          Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, making him the legitimate heir to the
          Iron Throne, a twist that changes the power dynamics in Westeros. His
          loyalty, sense of justice, and leadership were tested through numerous
          challenges, including battles against the White Walkers and his
          complicated relationship with Daenerys Targaryen. Jonâ€™s ultimate
          decision to sacrifice personal desires for the greater good defined
          his story.
