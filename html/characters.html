          Jon Snow, one of the most iconic characters in Game of Thrones, is
          portrayed by Kit Harington. Raised as the illegitimate son of Eddard
          Stark at Winterfell, Jon grew up facing stigma and isolation. He
          joined the Night's Watch, where he proved himself to be a natural
          leader and formidable fighter. Secretly, Jon is the son of Lyanna
          Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, making him the legitimate heir to the
          Iron Throne, a twist that changes the power dynamics in Westeros. His
          loyalty, sense of justice, and leadership were tested through numerous
          challenges, including battles against the White Walkers and his
          complicated relationship with Daenerys Targaryen. Jon’s ultimate
          decision to sacrifice personal desires for the greater good defined
          his story.

          Jaime Lannister, played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, is a complex figure
          in Game of Thrones. Known as the "Kingslayer," he earned infamy for
          killing King Aerys II Targaryen, an act seen as both treachery and
          heroism. As a skilled knight and member of the Kingsguard, Jaime's
          life was marked by loyalty to his powerful family, House Lannister. He
          has a complicated relationship with his twin sister, Cersei, which
          leads to moral conflicts and divided loyalties. Initially portrayed as
          arrogant and ruthless, Jaime’s character evolves, especially after his
          capture and interaction with Brienne of Tarth, revealing his honor and
          vulnerability. His internal struggle between familial duty and

          Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, is a fan-favorite
          character in Game of Thrones known for his sharp wit, intellect, and

          as her Hand, showcasing his loyalty and shrewdness. While he is

          independence that grows as she witnesses the brutal execution of her
          father and the collapse of her family’s power. Arya’s path takes her
          through hardship and training with the Faceless Men in Braavos, where
